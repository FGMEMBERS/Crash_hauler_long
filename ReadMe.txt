Thank you for reading this.  It will bring you up to speed faster than just driving the crash_vehicles.

Since no one reads the Authors file, you should know the following:

Credits:
The Crash_Hauler, Crash_hauler_long, and the Crash_camaro are all products of a FDM created by Anders Gidenstam for his Crash_tender.  Without it these vehicles would not exist.  The Crash_tender model by Alexis Bory is the basis for both hauler models.

- Additional thanks:
	Dave Culp for Drag Chutes and Beacons in the Davepack.
	Gary Neeley for ASI and DG indicators from the MD-81 and Goose.
	Detlef Faber for the Steering Wheel and Bucket Seats(modified) from the Jeep.
	Lanny Chambers for his extensive testing and feedback.


Requirements:
	- Must have "Davepack" installed, from David Culp's website (http://members.cox.net/davidculp/hangar.html)

**************** MUST READ ******************

General:
	All 3 crash_vehicles have plenty of power, and very little drag.
	This requires conservative use of the throttle, ample brake use, and most importantly SMALL steering inputs.

	We have designed these vehicles with numerous devices and specifications to promote stability and control recovery.
	This does not mean you can operate at the limits without crashing hard.

Crashes:
	JSBsim has issues when interacting with different surface faces, and will result in extremely hard crashes that may freeze FlightGear.
	After a crash, do not attempt to "reset", simply close or force quit FlightGear and restart.

Jumping:
	One of the enjoyable parts of the _hauler FDM is its terrain-climbing and terrain-jumping abilities.  These little haulers will leap and bound like no tomorrow.  But, this will also lead to unrecoverable crashes.  A little driving will show you the proper amount, but in general always apply brakes or move throttle to zero just before leaving the ground surface. This will help ensure an "arc" flightpath back to mother earth.
	You want to always attempt to land nose down or flat. Tail down landings are discouraged.
	In general, always release brakes before landing.
		*Note: Brakes cuts engine thrust AND applies brakes
	If you find the hauler attitude too far nose down while in the air, adding throttle will bring the nose up.
		*But conversely, removing throttle will _not_ bring the nose down.
	Again, best to always apply brakes and remove power while jumping.

Specific jumping:
	If you get into it, you may find it fun to set up jump ramps at different locations.
	I have a pre-made jump (modified from the original in FG/Models) set at KSFO, which allows you to jump up onto the Air-Train track that moves in around the terminal.  If you would like the location send me an email.

Rock-Climbing:
	Due to the impressive JSBsim FDM, you will find the _haulers will climb extreme objects.  For example, you can drive up on top of all three large hangars at Moffett Field.
	Take it slow or you'll jump right off the other side, and laugh all the way to the ground.
	You can cross the bridges, and solid bridges you'll find yourself driving over the top framework.

Recovery Devices:
	Anytime, and I do mean ANYTIME you find yourself approaching ground in a bad attitude, or starting to spin in the air, you must do two things.
	1) Pull the ripcord!
		*All 3 vehicles have ballistic drag chutes to enhance survival.
		90% of the time they will enable you to survive the crash and drive away.  The remainder, well, sorry!
		Ripcord is "d". Chute jettison is "j"

	2) Apply BRAKES!
		As mentioned above, Applying brakes will cut all thrust. 
		This is very important, as thrust is the enemy during a crash.
		Always apply brakes until safely stopped on the ground.



***************** General ***************

Camaro:
	The _camaro is a project in the works, and originally was a tail-happy flat ground machine.  I have since changed that to create more of an all-around car, but it still prefers the flat grounds of road ways and airport tarmacs.  It does not have the suspension, wheelbase, or stability of the _haulers.
